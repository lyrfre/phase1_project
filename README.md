# Lydia and Lyra Phase 1 Project: Art Curator
Based off of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

This Single Page Application showcases five revolutionary artists, their bios and three pieces of art per artist. Each artist's artwork can be showcased via click event on each of their pictures. Comments on the exhibit are able to be posted on the bottom of the page via submit event.

# Other Information
## Installation
Clone the repository and open in your local editor, enter `json-server db.json --routes routes.json` into the terminal. It is slightly different fom the typical command because we have an embedded .json object that requires a different command.

## Usage
To explore various artists, click on each artist and scroll to see their work! Feel free to leave a comment about the exhibition as a whole at the bottom of the page.
